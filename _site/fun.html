<p>As a #millenial, my life has accumulated a variety of references on the Internet. To save you some cyber-sleuthing, here’s my authoritative commentary on references that I’m aware of:</p>

<p>In June 2018, my <a href="../publications/">paper on private browsing</a> was written about <a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/private-internet-browsing-not-secure-most-think-researchers-find">by the UChicago News</a>. A quote from the interview I did for this article was featured on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/uchicago/photos/a.10150225989660650.472028.192609620649/10160749728785650/?type=3&amp;permPage=1">UChicago’s Facebook page</a>, much to the amusement of my Facebook friends.</p>

<p>In October 2017, I began my tenure as the second director of MPOST. Our first event was <a href="https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2016/11/4/security-rso-partners-chicago-project-security-ter/">covered by the Chicago Maroon</a>, University of Chicago’s student-run newspaper.</p>

<p>In Fall 2015/Winter 2016, I participated in University of Chicago MODA’s Designer Bootcamp (DBC). As part of DBC, I took a 6-week course on fashion design and tailoring, and was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SP-q08SPVA">interviewed by Maroon TV</a> about being a DBC designer. At the end, I presented my very own fashion collection (designed and created by me) at MODA’s annual fashion show! Unfortunately pictures of said collection may have been lost to time.</p>

<p>In December 2011, I earned my black belt in Taekwondo after eight years of training at my dojang, Young Tigers. Among other parts of my black belt test, I used a hammerfist to break a block of concrete (<a href="http://www.youngtigers.com/photos/20111203/20111203_miranda_breaking_photo.htm">photos</a> and <a href="http://www.youngtigers.com/videos/20111203_belt_test/20111203_miranda_breaking.htm">video</a>). My black belt senior thesis was published in the <a href="http://www.youngtigers.com/news/korean_quarterly_2012_spring.htm">Korean Quarterly</a> and the <a href="http://www.youngtigers.com/news/glenview_lantern_20120222.htm">Glenview Lantern</a>.
Many thanks to Grandmaster Ho B. Kim, who taught me to strive to be the light in the darkness (unfortunately I’m not sure where the accompanying flashlight went), to not <em>let</em> others get me down, and how to deliver a killer roundhouse kick. For the record, my favorite form is PalbalngMoo #2, and no, I’m not required to register my hands as weapons.</p>

<h1 id="travel">Travel</h1>

<p>I love traveling, especially as a way to try new foods, see new places, and pick up new threads. So far I’m at 28 countries!</p>

<h1 id="blog">Blog</h1>

<p>From July 2018 to September 2018 (anticipated), I lived in Nepal with my partner, Ivan. We stayed in Kathmandu, Patan, and did some trekking in Annapurna. Ivan wrote about it, and I took pictures - check it out on our blog, <a href="https://5412sda.blogspot.com/">5412sda</a>.</p>
