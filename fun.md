# An Abbreviated Life Story, According to the Internet

As a #millenial, my life has accumulated a variety of references on the Internet. To save you some cyber-sleuthing, here's my authoritative commentary on references that I'm aware of:

In June 2018, my [paper on private browsing](../publications/) was written about [by the UChicago News](https://news.uchicago.edu/story/private-internet-browsing-not-secure-most-think-researchers-find). A quote from the interview I did for this article was featured on [UChicago's Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/uchicago/photos/a.10150225989660650.472028.192609620649/10160749728785650/?type=3&permPage=1), much to the amusement of my Facebook friends.

In October 2017, I began my tenure as the second director of MPOST. Our first event was [covered by the Chicago Maroon](https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2016/11/4/security-rso-partners-chicago-project-security-ter/), University of Chicago's student-run newspaper.

In Fall 2015/Winter 2016, I participated in University of Chicago MODA's Designer Bootcamp (DBC). As part of DBC, I took a 6-week course on fashion design and tailoring, and was [interviewed by Maroon TV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SP-q08SPVA) about being a DBC designer. At the end, I presented my very own fashion collection (designed and created by me) at MODA's annual fashion show! 

In December 2011, I earned my black belt in Taekwondo after eight years of training at my dojang, Young Tigers. Among other parts of my black belt test, I used a hammerfist to break a block of concrete ([photos](http://www.youngtigers.com/photos/20111203/20111203_miranda_breaking_photo.htm) and [video](http://www.youngtigers.com/videos/20111203_belt_test/20111203_miranda_breaking.htm)). My black belt senior thesis was published in the [Korean Quarterly](http://www.youngtigers.com/news/korean_quarterly_2012_spring.htm) and the [Glenview Lantern](http://www.youngtigers.com/news/glenview_lantern_20120222.htm).
Many thanks to Grandmaster Ho B. Kim, who taught me to strive to be the light in the darkness, to not _let_ others get me down, and how to deliver the perfect roundhouse kick. For the record, my favorite form is PalbalngMoo \#2, and no, I'm not required to register my hands as weapons.

# Travel

I love traveling, especially as a way to try new foods, see new places, and pick up new threads. So far I'm at 28 countries!

# Blog

From July 2018 to September 2018, I lived in Nepal with my partner, Ivan. We stayed in Kathmandu, Patan, and did some trekking in Annapurna. Ivan wrote about it, and I took pictures - check it out on our blog, [5412sda](https://5412sda.blogspot.com/).
