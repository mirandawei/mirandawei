Hi there! I'm Miranda.

I'm a recent grad from the University of Chicago, and currently working as a researcher at UChicago's SUPERgroup. [My research](./publications) focuses on the usability of computer security and privacy. I'm especially interested in how average users imagine, interact with, and are influenced by technology. Generally, I love asking people about what they love, what they hate, and anything else they feel strongly about.

I was born and raised in Chicago (unless you're from the city, in which case I was born and raised in the suburbs). I studied political science and computer science during my undergraduate degree, and graduated in June 2017.
